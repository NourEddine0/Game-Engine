#Game Engine
## Getting Started
`To run the file` : there are a few things that should be made so that the file runs correctly.
1. Make sure to enable Ansi colors on the command line, please refer to this link for more info "https://ss64.com/nt/syntax-ansi.html#:~:text=To%20use%20ANSI%20colours%20in,the%20terminal%20and%20in%20ConPTY.&text=Alternatively%20it%20can%20be%20enabled,API%20with%20the%20ENABLE_VIRTUAL_TERMINAL_PROCESSING%20flag."
2. To run the engine double-click the `run.bat` present in the `/out/artifacts/Game_Engine_jar/`
3. Alternatively, the jar could be run by running the command `java -jar "Game Engine.jar"` in the `/out/artifacts/Game_Engine_jar/` directory.
